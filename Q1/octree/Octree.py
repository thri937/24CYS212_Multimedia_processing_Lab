    #Perform Octree color quantization on an image using Pillow's FASTOCTREE method.

    print(f"Quantizing image to max {max_colors} colors using FASTOCTREE method...")

    # Perform quantization using Pillow's built-in octree quantizer.
    # How octree quantization works internally:
    # - The RGB color space is represented as a tree with up to 8 children per node (an octree).
    # - Each level of the tree examines one bit of the R, G, and B channels, dividing color space into smaller cubes.
    # - Colors from the image are inserted into the tree according to their bits, accumulating counts and sums.
    # - To reduce colors, the tree is pruned by merging nodes with similar colors until only max_colors leaves remain.
    # - The leaves of the tree become the palette colors used to represent the image.
    # This method efficiently groups similar colors and keeps those most visually relevant,
    # resulting in a palette-based (mode 'P') image with quality close to the original but fewer colors.

    quantized_img = img.quantize(colors=max_colors, method=Image.Quantize.FASTOCTREE)

    # Save the quantized image in a file format supporting palette mode (PNG recommended).
    quantized_img.save(output_path)
    print(f"Quantized image saved to: {output_path}")
